                    <h1>Welcome to Leavenworth</h1>
                    <p>Leavenworth, Kansas also known as "The First City in Kansas"is a small city located in the northeast region of the state of Kansas. This 
                        small city sits right next to the Missouri river and is home to Fort Leavenworth and the infamous Leavenworth Federal Penetentiary. The constant stream of military members moving in and out of Leavenworth, with some choosing to stay and retire here, has created a pattern of steady growth for the city.
